Multiple never possible before java 8
as
extending classes doesnt allow multiple classes to get extended, but it was allowed in case of interface.
But prior to java 8 interface doesnt allows methods with body so multiple inheritance in case of interface 
was impossible.

But now after java8 interface allows the default and static methods along with abstract methods so now
we can achieve multiple inheritance with interfaces..
